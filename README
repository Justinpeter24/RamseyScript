LANGUAGE SPECIFICATION

===============
Variables
===============

  set <max-iterations | max-depth | gap-set | n-colors | ap-length |
       random-length | alphabet | dump-file> <value>

Sets a variable. Not all variables are effective for each search space.

max-iterations: The number of iterations to run before stopping, or 0 to
                search the entire space.
                Default value: 0

  alphabet: The alphabet to use when searching words. Specified in the
            format [c1 c2 c3 ... cn].
            Default value: [1 2 3 4]

 ap-length: The length of arithmetic progressions to check when using
            AP-related filters. (This may be broken up into a min/max
            pair if needed. But for now the only supported value is 3,
            so this would be superfluous.)
            Default value: 3

 dump-file: The file to output dump output (see 'dump'), or "-" to use
            stdout.
            Default value: -

   gap-set: The set of allowable gap sizes when searching sequences or
            colorings. For sequences, the value must be a 1D sequence
            of the form [x y z] containing the allowable gap sizes.

            For colorings, if the gap-set is a sequence, this sequence
            defines the allowable gap sizes for each color. Alternately,
            if the gap-set is a coloring (i.e., a sequence of sequences)
            then each color of the gap-set defines the allowable gap
            sizes for the respective colors in the search space.
            Default value: [1 ... 1000]

 max-depth: The maximum depth to search the space, or 0 for no maximum.
            Default value: 0

  n-colors: The number of colors to use when searching colorings.
            Default value: 3

 random-length: If the seed is set to RANDOM on a supported space, this
                sets the length of the generated seed.
                Default value: 10



===============
Filters
===============

  filter <no-3-aps | no-double-3-aps | no-additive-squares>

Chooses which filter to when searching spaces.

             no-3-aps: Only recurse on objects with no 3-AP's

      no-double-3-aps: Only recurse on objects with no double-3-AP's

  no-additive-squares: Only recurse on words with no additive squares



===============
Search Spaces
===============

  search <sequences | colorings | words | permutations> [seed]

Selects a search space and recursively explores it, looking for longer
and longer elements which satisfy the given filter. There is no default
value. If you do not specify a 'search' line, the program will do
nothing.


   colorings: The space of r-colorings of integers, for some given r.
              For colorings, the seed may be RANDOM, in which case a
              seed of length random-length is generated.
              Default seed: [[1] [] []]

  partitions: synonym of 'colorings'

permutations: The space of permutations of [1,n]. You cannot change
              the seed for this space.
              Default seed: [1]

   sequences: The space of strictly increasing sequences
              Default seed: [1]

       words: The space of words on some given alphabet
              Default seed: []



===============
Additional Output
===============

  dump <iterations-per-length>

Output auxiliary data about the search space or program operation.

iterations-per-length: dump the number of iterations spent at each
                       search-space depth





EXAMPLES
===================

## Look for 2-colorings of [1, N] with no double-3-ap's
## This will find that there is no such coloring of [1, 17],
## though there is one of [1, 16].

## Explore the space of 3-colorings of [1, N] with no double-3-ap's.
## One does exist of [1, 390], but this is all that is known so far.

filter no-double-3-aps
set max-iterations 10000000

search colorings RANDOM
search colorings RANDOM
search colorings RANDOM
search colorings RANDOM
search colorings RANDOM

# (end file)



## Explore the space of permutations with no 3-AP's. Output the iterations
## at each depth (i.e., the number of valid permutations of each length)
## to output.dump.

# Note that since the search space is not pruned efficiently (read: at all)
# this search will take far longer than it should.

# The resultant output will match the values computed by G.J. Simmons.
# See American Mathematical Monthly 82 (1975) pp. 76-77.
