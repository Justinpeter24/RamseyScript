LANGUAGE SPECIFICATION
=======================

  set <min_gap | max_gap | n_colors | ap_length | alphabet> <value>

Sets a variable. Not all variables are effective for each search space.

   min_gap: The minimum gap size for sequences and colorings
            Default value: 1

   max_gap: The maximum gap size for sequences and colorings, or 0 for
            no maximum.
            Default value: 0

  n_colors: The number of colors to use when searching colorings.
            Default value: 3

 ap_length: The length of arithemetic progressions to check when using
            AP-related filters. (This may be broken up into a min/max
            pair if needed. But for now the only supported value is 3,
            so this would be superfluous.)
            Default value: 3

  alphabet: The alphabet to use when searching words. Specified in the
            format [c1 c2 c3 ... cn].
            Default value: [1 2 3 4]



  filter <no-double-3-aps | no-additive-squares>

Chooses which filter to when searching spaces. If you choose a filter
that doesn't make sense for your search space (i.e., searching for
strictly increasing sequences with no additive squares), the program
will not catch this and simply recurse indefinitely (since every
strictly increasing sequence is additive-square-free).

The default filter is no-double-3-aps, but it is not recommended to
rely on this.

      no-double-3-aps: Only recurse on sequences or colorings with no
                       double 3-AP's.

  no-additive-squares: Only recurse on words with no additive squares



  search <sequences | colorings | words> [seed]

Selects a search space and recursively explores it, looking for longer
and longer elements which satisfy the given filter. There is no default
value. If you do not specify a 'search' line, the program will do
nothing.


   sequences: The space of strictly increasing sequences
              Default seed: [1]

   colorings: The space of r-colorings of integers, for some given r.
              Default seed: [[1] [] []]

  partitions: synonym of 'colorings'

       words: The space of words on some given alphabet
              Default seed: []
