LANGUAGE SPECIFICATION
=======================

  set <iterations | min-gap | max_gap | n-colors | ap-length |
       alphabet | dump-file> <value>

Sets a variable. Not all variables are effective for each search space.

iterations: The number of iterations to run before stopping, or 0 to
            search the entire space.
            Default value: 0

   min-gap: The minimum gap size for sequences and colorings. Ignored
            if gap_set is set.
            Default value: 1

   max-gap: The maximum gap size for sequences and colorings, or 0 for
            no maximum. Ignored if gap_set is set.
            Default value: 0

  n-colors: The number of colors to use when searching colorings.
            Default value: 3

 ap-length: The length of arithmetic progressions to check when using
            AP-related filters. (This may be broken up into a min/max
            pair if needed. But for now the only supported value is 3,
            so this would be superfluous.)
            Default value: 3

  alphabet: The alphabet to use when searching words. Specified in the
            format [c1 c2 c3 ... cn].
            Default value: [1 2 3 4]

   gap-set: The set of allowable gap sizes when searching sequences. If
            unset, all gaps between min_gap and max_gap (inclusive) will
            be allowed.
            format [g1 g2 g3 ... gn].
            Default value: [min_gap ... max_gap]

 dump-file: The file to output dump output (see 'dump'), or "-" to use
            stdout.
            Default value: -

dump-depth: The maximum depth to output iteration counts for, if this
            output is enabled. (See 'dump'.)
            Default value: 400

  filter <no-double-3-aps | no-additive-squares>

Chooses which filter to when searching spaces. WARNING: If you choose a
filter that doesn't make sense for your search space (e.g., looking for
strictly increasing sequences with no additive squares), the program
won't catch this. (Since no strictly increasing sequence has an additive
square, in this case it would simply recurse indefinitely.)

      no-double-3-aps: Only recurse on sequences or colorings with no
                       double 3-AP's.

  no-additive-squares: Only recurse on words with no additive squares



  search <sequences | colorings | words> [seed]

Selects a search space and recursively explores it, looking for longer
and longer elements which satisfy the given filter. There is no default
value. If you do not specify a 'search' line, the program will do
nothing.


   sequences: The space of strictly increasing sequences
              Default seed: [1]

   colorings: The space of r-colorings of integers, for some given r.
              Default seed: [[1] [] []]

  partitions: synonym of 'colorings'

       words: The space of words on some given alphabet
              Default seed: []



  dump <iterations-per-length>

Output auxiliary data about the search space or program operation.

iterations-per-length: dump the number of iterations spent at each
                       search-space depth
